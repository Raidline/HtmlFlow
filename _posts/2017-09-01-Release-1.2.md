* Refactor unit tests to increase code coverage and to load the expected HTML output from the resources.

* Include HtmlFlow in [SonarCloud.io](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=com.github.fmcarvalho%3Ahtmlflow) to analyze code quality.

* Fix of [Issue 14](https://github.com/xmlet/HtmlFlow/issues/24) -- _Header.txt can't be loaded from resources_.
